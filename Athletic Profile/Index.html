        <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>Jarome Iginla is the franchise leader in points and goals for The Calgary Flames. With such a scoring touch, it would be surprising to note that he began his hockey life between the posts. His junior career was played for the Kamaloops Blazers. When Jarome was traded to the Calgary Flames in exchange for then super-star, Joe Nieuwendyk. When Jarome was told of the trade to Calgary, he thought he was being traded to The Calgary junior team, The Calgary Hitmen.</P> 
            <br>
            <p>Jarome Quickly made a name for himself in The National Hockey League. He was a gritty yet finesse forward who would not only lite the goal lamps, but would also deliver solid checks and was not shy to drop the gloves. Truly, he was an all-rounded player. Any fan who would meet him would note that he was a nice guy as well.</p>
            <br>

                <br>
                <il>-Coming one game short of winning The Stanley Cup (A,K.A. The Cup was stolen from The Flames, because the puck went in.)</il>
